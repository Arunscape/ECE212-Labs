\section{Introduction}
This lab deals with stack operation (push and pop), segmenting a long program/function into several smaller and simpler subroutines/sub-functions. Each part uses these subroutines in order to produce the final output of the program which is statistical information about the input values, including the mean, max, min and number of entries divisible by another specified value.  The subroutines must be run in order, however each is designed to be transparent and to flow seamlessly together.  In addition this lab introduces the use of strings for user prompts, allowing the user to get feedback from the program as well as information about what they should enter at each step.  These two combined are major aspects of programming in assembly.  Subroutines allow a longer task to be subdivided into smaller pieces that can be called multiple times if required, and text prompts help not only with the execution of the program by the users, but also with the debugging by the developers.


  \subsection{Part A}
  In part A, the subroutine was made to take in the user values. The subroutine is transparent thus it stores the values in the registers before it executes.  The first value must be a positive integer in the range of 3-15, and this represents the number of entries to be taken in a future step. The second value is divisor which must be an integer between 2 and 5. Finally N positive integers are taken in, where N is the integer from the first part of this step.  At the end of this phase the registers are restored and the stack is reset.
  \subsection{Part B}
  In part B the statistical values are calculated from the values taken in from part A.  The maximum value and minimum value of the array of numbers, as well as the mean value, and finally the number of values divisible by the divisor, as well as what those values were.  These outputs are stored in the stack to be referenced later.  As before this is a transparent subroutine thus the values in the registers are preserved and restored after the execution of this subroutine.
  \subsection{Part C}
  The final subroutine is also transparent as above, and the registers are stored and restored.  This subroutine is used to output all the values from part B in an easy to read format with labels and information for the user.  Overall these three segments demonstrate how to handle these subroutines and how to make sure they all work together as expected.

\section{Design}
  \subsection{Part A}
    For the first part of the lab, we begin by writing our own subroutine.
    Some code was already supplied such that:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Stack Entry Condition =
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item Space allocated for the number of entries on stack (long word)
          \item Space allocated for the divisor number on stack (long word)
        \end{enumerate}
      \item Stack Exit Condtion =
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item Number of entries on stack (long word)
          \item Divisor number on stack (long word)
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{figure}[h!]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{designa.jpg}
      \caption{Visualization of the stack for Part A}
    \end{figure}

    We started by editing \textit{Lab3a.s}, and chose to back up
    address registers \textit{a2-a6} and the data registers \textit{d2-d7}. Since the stack pointer
    was \textit{a7}, this was accomplished by subtracting 44 from the stack pointer,
    then using the \textit{movem} command to push the values onto the stack. Then at the end, just before
    the \textit{rts} command in the subroutine, we move the values we backed up to the registers
    as they were before running the subroutine. Address register \textit{a2} was chosen to
    hold the memory location of where the valid numbers which were entered would go, which
    was 0x2300000.
    Next, at the very end of the file, we
    defined several messages as strings that would be used as prompts. Labels are used to reference
    these strings, which are used for prompting the user in the MTTTY serial monitor to enter relevant data for each part.

    With the initial setup for this subroutine completed, we moved on to
    actually coding the prompt messages for the program. We begin by
    pushing the Welcome Prompt onto the stack, and using the provided \textit{iprintf}
    and \textit{cr} subroutines to print the Welcome Message and a carriage return for the
    user. Once the message was displayed, we immediately clean up the stack by adding 4
    to the stack pointer, since the address of the message was pushed onto the stack,
    and addresses take up 4 bytes of memory. For every message printed onwards,
    we immediately clean up the stack after the message is printed. We then branch to a label where the user
    is prompted to enter the number of entries. The subroutine getstr, which was provided captures input from the serial monitor,
    and puts it into data register \textit{d0}. For this part, the only
    valid entries are the numbers 3-15, with anything else entered being rejected.
    This was accomplished by comparing the input to the number 15. If the number was
    greater than 15. we branch to a label to warn the user that an invalid entry was entered,
    and then the program returns to the label which prompts the user to enter
    the number of entries. Similarly, if the value entered was less than 3, the same thing would occur.
    If the entry was valid, we put the numentries value that the user entered in the spot reserved on the
    stack for us. This value was also copied to \textit{d7}, which is later used as a counter
    for when the user enters the numbers. As a feature for the user, if the input was
    accepted, the value is printed to the serial monitor for the user to see. This is done
    in a similar method to how the messages are printed onto the stack.

    In a very similar fashion, the user is then prompted to enter the divisor number.
    Here, the accepted values were from 2-5, with the data validation checks happening in
    almost exactly the same was as outlined above for entering the number of entries.
    The divisor also went into a spot on the stack, which was reserved for us.

    Next, we enter a loop, where the user is prompted to enter numbers, until
    the user enters as many numbers as the user declared when prompted to enter the number of entries.
    The loop itself loops numentries-1 times, since there's a different prompt message for the
    last number. As mentioned earlier, we use \textit{d7} as our counter, since numentries was
    copied to this data register. The user then goes through the same process of
    entering numbers, and is prompted to re-enter the number if it is not positive.
    This is done similarly to above, in that the number entered is compared to the
    number 1, and if the number entered is less than 1, we branch to a label where
    the user is warned about the mistake, and then branches back to continue the loop.
    If the number is accepted, then it is printed to the serial monitor, and then the
    number entered is moved to the address location pointed to by \textit{a2}, and \textit{a2} is post
    incremented. On each successful loop iteration, the number 1 is subtracted from
    the counter \textit{d7}, until the counter is 1.

    At this point, the user needs to enter one last number, for which there is
    an appropriate prompt, and the data validation is the exact same as above,
    with only positive values being accepted. If the number is valid, then it is
    printed to the serial monitor, and moved to the memory location where \textit{a2} points.

    Finally, we reach the part where the backed up registers on the stack are restored,
    and the subroutine hits the \textit{rts} command.

    % \subsubsection{Part A Sample Calculations of Conversion}
    %
    %     input = `9' = 0x39\\
    %     0x39 - 0x30 = 0x9\\
    %     \\
    %     input = `E' = 0x45\\
    %     0x45 - 0x41 = 0x4\\
    %     0x4 + 0xA = 0xE\\

    %     0x64 - 0x61 = 0x3\\
    %     0x3 + 0xA = 0xD

  \subsection{Part B}
    In Part B, another subroutine is written, which computes some stats
    on the numbers entered. Similar to Part A, some code was provided
    such that the stack entry and exit conditions are as follows:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Stack Entry Condition =
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item Space allocated for how many numbers are divisible by the divisor (long word)
          \item Number of entries (long word) on stack
          \item Divisor number (long word) on stack
        \end{enumerate}
      \item Stack Exit Condtion =
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item How many numbers are divisible by the divisor (long word) on stack
          \item Number of entries on stack (long word)
          \item Divisor number on stack (long word)
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{figure}[h!]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{designb.jpg}
      \caption{Visualization of the stack for Part B}
    \end{figure}

    We begin by backing up the registers \textit{a0-a6} and \textit{d0-d7} by
    subtracting 60 from the stack pointer, and then using the \textit{movem}
    command to push those values onto the stack. Similarly, at the end of the
    subroutine just before rts, we restore the values by using \textit{movem} to restore the values,
    then add 60 to the stack pointer before returning to the previous subroutine.

    We begin by reading the numentries and divisor off of the stack, which
    were put there by the subroutine in Part A. The addresses 0x2300000
    and 0x2310000 were loaded into address registers \textit{a2} and \textit{a3} respectively.
    \textit{a2} kept track of the location were the numbers were entered, and \textit{a3}
    kept track of where the min, mean, max, and divisible numbers would be output.

    To begin calculating the minimum number, we copy the numentries to another
    data register to use as a counter. The first number is read by indirectly addressing
    \textit{a2} with a post increment, and moved to a data register which will hold the
    final minimum value. Inside a loop, which loops numentries-1
    times, (since the first number was already read), the next number is read by indirectly
    addressing \textit{a2} with a post increment, and
    moved into a temporary data register, where it is then compared to the data register
    which is supposed to hold the minimum value. If the temporary value is less than the
    minimum value, we move the temporary value to the data register which holds the minumum value.
    If the temporary value is greater than the current minimum, then the loop continues.
    At the end of every loop iteration, the loop counter is decremented by 1, and compared
    to the number 1, since it loops numentries-1 times. Once this loop is complete,
    the minumum value is stored in data register \textit{d5}, so we move it to
    the memory location pointed at by \textit{a3} and post increment it.

    The maximum number is calculated in a very similar manner compared to how
    the min was calculated. First, \textit{a2} is reset to 0x2300000, and the loop counter
    is reset to numentries, since we post
    incremented \textit{a2} when finding the min, and we decremented the counter
    when going through the numbers again to find the min.
    Then, we go through a loop that is almost the same as for calculating the minumum number.
    except that the current maximum number is held in one data register,
    and a temporary value is read and compared to the maximum number. If the temporary
    number is greater than the current maximum, then the temporary number becomes the
    maximum, and by the end of the loop, the maximum value is stored in data register \textit{d6},
    so we move it to
    the memory location pointed at by \textit{a3} and post increment it.

    To find the mean, address register \textit{a2} was reset to 0x2300000,
    and the loop counter was reset to numentries again. A data register was used
    to store the cumulative sum of the numbers, which was accomplished by
    first clearing the data register, then looping over the list of
    numbers entered (pointed at by \textit{a2}), and adding each number
    to the sum. This was done by indirectly addressing \textit{a2} with
    a post increment to copy the value to a data register, then adding
    that value to our cumulative sum. At the end of the loop, we have the
    cumulative sum, so to
    find the mean, we simply divide the cumulative sum by the numentries
    by using \textit{divs.l}. When the division was complete, the
    mean was stored in data register \textit{d4}, so so we move it to
    the memory location pointed at by \textit{a3} and post increment it.

    Finally, to find the divisible numbers, we once more reset \textit{a2}
    to 0x2300000, and the loop counter to numentries. We go through one last loop,
    where a number is read by indirectly addressing \textit{a2}, moving it to
    a data register, and then using \textit{divs.w} to divide the number by the
    divisor, since \textit{divs.w} provides the remainder stored in the
    16 most significant bits. If the number is divisible, it
    should not have a remainder, so we check the remainder by
    bit shifting the division result 16 bits to the right, and check if
    the remainder is 0. If so, a counter which holds the number of
    divisible numbers is incremented by 1, and the divisible number
    is moved to the location pointed at by \textit{a3} and post incremented.
    The loop then continues until all the numbers have been processed. At the
    end of the loop, the number of divisible entries is stored in data register \textit{d7},
    so we move it to the spot reserved on the stack for us.

    We then reach the end of the subroutine, where we restore the backed up register values
    on the stack, add 60 to the stack pointer, and return to the previous subroutine.


    \subsubsection{Sample Calculations}
    Numbers entered: 1,2,3,4,5\\
    Numentries: 5\\
    Divisor: 2\\ \\
    Min: 1\\
    Max: 5\\
    Mean: $\frac{1+2+3+4+5}{5}=3$\\
    Numdivisible: 2\\
    Divisible numbers: 2,4


    \subsection{Part C}

    In Part C, the last subroutine is written, which prints the stats
    on the numbers entered. Similar to the previous parts, some code was provided
    such that the stack entry and exit conditions are as follows:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Stack Entry Condition =
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item How many numbers were divisible by the divisor
          \item Number of entries (long word)
          \item Divisor number (long word)
        \end{enumerate}
      \item Stack Exit Condtion =
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item How many numbers are divisible by the divisor
          \item Number of entries (long word)
          \item Divisor number (long word)
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{figure}[h!]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{designc.jpg}
      \caption{Visualization of the stack for Part C}
    \end{figure}

    Just like in part B, we begin by backing up the registers \textit{a0-a6} and \textit{d0-d7} by
    subtracting 60 from the stack pointer, and then using the \textit{movem}
    command to push those values onto the stack. Similarly, at the end of the
    subroutine just before rts, we restore the values by using \textit{movem} to restore the values,
    then add 60 to the stack pointer before returning to the previous subroutine.
    We begin by loading 0x2300000 into \textit{a2}, 0x2310000 into \textit{a3},
    and the divisor, numentries, and numdivisible are read from the stack and
    moved into data registers.

    At the very end of the program, we define strings just like
    in Part A, which are printed for the user to read.
    We begin by first printing the number of entries.
    A message is printed by pushing the address of a string defined earlier
    onto the stack, and using \textit{iprintf}. Next, the actual
    number of entries is pushed onto the stack and printed to the
    serial monitor using the subroutine \textit{value}. The stack is also cleaned up by
    adding to the stack pointer. The user is then prompted that the numbers will
    be printed, which is done in a very similar manner, using \textit{iprintf}. Then,
    a loop iterates over the numbers, which are indirectly addressed with \textit{a2} with post increment,
    and printed with the subroutine \textit{value}. The data register holding the numentries
    is decremented at the end of each iteration of the loop, until it reaches 0, which is
    when all the numbers have been printed. The min, max, mean, and number of divisible numbers are all printed
    in a similar manner to how the numentries was printed, with a message
    printed first using \textit{iprintf}, and then the value being printed
    with the subroutine \textit{value}. Whenever something is printed, the stack is
    immediately cleaned up afterwards by adding 4 to the stack pointer whenever a value is printed.

    Finally, in a manner similar to how the numbers were printed, the
    divisible numbers are printed by indirectly addressing \textit{a3} with post
    increment, putting the number on the stack, and jumping to the subroutine
    \textit{value} to print the numbers. This happens in a loop, with numdivisible
    being decremented at the end of each loop iteration, until all the
    divisible numbers are printed out.

    At the end of the subroutine, the string ``End of program'' is printed
    to let the user know that the program has ended.

\section{Testing}
  \subsection{Part A}
    Initially, we visually tested our code by using the debugger in Eclipse IDE.
    While stepping through the code, we would check the values at relevant memory
    locations, and the data and address registers. Extra care had to be taken
    while monitoring the stack pointer, as it was very easy to miss an off-by-one
    error, and then have the program crash unexpectedly. On many occasions, the
    board had to be flashed with its default program when our would not
    upload. This was done by pressing the blue reset button, then typing \textit{Shift + A}
    within 2 seconds. Next, \textit{fla} was typed in and then the \textit{F5} key was pressed
    where we could then send the default program to the microcontroller and
    re flash our program when trying to debug it. A lab TA showed us a helpful
    debugging practice, which was to insert a breakpoint at the very beginning
    of the subroutine, and at the very end. Using this method allowed us to see if our
    program at least produced the correct output before the trap error occurs.
    At least for this first part, a brute force approach also helped, where
    the value we wanted to replace on the stack was increased by 4 and re-uploaded to
    the microcontroller until the program worked. However, we quickly realized that
    this method was much less effective when we worked on Part B, which was more complicated
    and thus required a thorough understanding of how the stack works. When the bugs were ironed out
    our code was tested using the provided \textit{Lab3.s} file. More specifically,
    this program was moved into the project folder along with \textit{main.cpp},
    and the program's functionality was verified. We intentionally
    entered invalid data such as negative numbers, or numbers outside of the accepted ranges
    at each step, and actually discovered a small bug, where
    our program accepted divisors ranging from 3-15 instead of 2-5. Luckily this
    was a trivial fix, since only two numbers had to be tweaked in the code.
    When we had a working solution for Part A, we moved on to Part B.
    % further tested by replacing the `DataStorage.s' file with the other variants provided
    % named: \textit{DataStorage1.s}, \textit{DataStorage2.s}, and \textit{DataStorage3.s}.
    % Finally, our program, which produced the correct output, was verified by a lab TA.

    \begin{figure}[H]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{parta.jpg}
      \caption{MTTTY output when testing our Part A solution}
    \end{figure}

  \subsection{Part B}
    The procedure for testing our code for part B was similar to the process
    described above in Part A. We visually inspected our code in the Eclipse IDE,
    used the Eclipse debugger to step through our code, and monitor relevant
    memory addresses and registers. This part certainly proved to
    be more involved than Part A, in that a brute force approach to
    stop the program from crashing would take too long. Deeeper inspection
    was required when monitoring the memory addresses and stack pointer, as
    well as a thorough understanding of what was happpening on the stack
    in order to catch errors. The default program also had to
    be re-uploaded many more times (compared to Part A) when the microcontroller froze.
    In the end, however, the program worked, and we verified the output
    by plugging numbers into our calculators to verify the mean and divisible numbers,
    and then visually inspecting the min, max, and numdivisible values.
    When we had a working solution for Part A, we moved on to Part C.

    \begin{figure}[H]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{partb.jpg}
      \caption{MTTTY output when testing our Part B solution}
    \end{figure}

    \subsection{Part C}
      The procedure for testing our code for Part C felt more trivial
      than for Parts A and B, likely as a result from the practice
      we had debugging those parts. We took care to avoid the
      mistakes made when writing Parts A and B, such as forgetting
      to clean up the stack or not understanding where the values
      are on the stack. This resulted in producing a working solution for
      Part C in a efficient manner. When testing, we ran into a small bug where
      the program would enter an infinite loop displaying random numbers, when
      it was supposed to only display the numbers divisible by the divisor that the
      user enterered. Using our previous debugging experience from Parts A and
      B, we quickly discovered that we had mixed up the data registers which hold
      the numdivisible and the divisor values, and then verified our
      solution by checking the numbers, and manually calculating the mean ourselves
      to verify the program's output.

        \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{partc.jpg}
        \caption{MTTTY output when testing our Part C solution}
      \end{figure}

      Finally, our solution was verified by a lab TA. We initially entered values
      on our own, with invalid data as well to show how our
      program re-prompts the user to re-enter the data. Then, the TA tried several
      futher test cases to validate our solution.

\section{Questions}

    \subsection{Question 1}
      \textit{Is it always necessary to implement either callee or caller preservation of registers when calling a subroutine. Why?}
      \\ \\
      \noindent\textbf{A:}
      Yes, because pretty much all subroutines need to modify registers to get anything meaningful done,
      whether the subroutine needs to store a temporary value, do some addition, or
      keep track of a memory location. Without the preservation of registers, the subroutine will
      modify registers that the caller may have been using, which will likely result
      in unexpected behavior in the caller or callee programs. However, not all registers
      need to be backed up. The only registers which need to be backed up and restored are the
      ones that the subroutine modifies.
      i.e. you don't want to overwrite the data in a register that the previous subroutine might need
    \subsection{Question 2}
      \textit{Is it always necessary to clean up the stack. Why?}
      \\ \\
      \noindent\textbf{A:}
      Not necessarily but it is good practice, and you run the risk of memory leaks
      or trap errors from attempting to access a restricted memory location.
      Cleaning up the stack saves a lot of headaches, and it makes it easier to keep
      track of the values that your program uses. It also prevents
      your program from behaving unexpectedly.

      \subsection{Question 3} \textit{If a proper check for the getstring
      function was not provided and you have access to the buffer, how would you
      check to see if a valid \# was entered? A detailed description is
      sufficient. You do not need to implement this in your code.
    %   \\ \\
    %   ``Hello Students,
		% In question no. 3, you are asked to answer the following:
		% You have to describe how you are going to check that the entered number is valid or not.
		% For example, one entry is say 409 and another is 4h9. Here, 4h9 is a wrong number. Now please explain how are you going to check that?
		% Thanks.''
    }

      \noindent\textbf{A:}
      Since we have direct access to the buffer, we can read one byte of the input at a time,
      and compare it to the ASCII range for the characters `0' - `9', which happens to be
      the hex values 30-39. This would be done in a similar fashion to how we checked
      if the number entered was between 3-15 when validating the input for numentries.
      If any of the bytes is not within the ASCII range `0' - `9', then we
      know that the whole number entered is not valid. i.e. if the byte entered
      is greater than 39 or less than 30, the character is invalid, which makes the whole
      entry invalid. \\
      Example:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item ASCII(9) = 0x39 -valid
        \item ASCII(h) = 0x68 -invalid
        \item ASCII(0) = 0x30 -valid
        \item ASCII(4) = 0x34 -valid
      \end{itemize}
      Therefore, the entry 409 would be valid, and 4h9 would be invalid.

\section{Conclusion}
  \textbf{FILLITIN}
  This lab demonstrated how to create and use subroutines to create effective, modular code efficiently inside the Coldfire Assembly.  In addition we got a better understanding of how to create custom prompts to improve user experience and improve efficiency of debugging.  For the first part of this lab we had encountered some hardware issues and issues with the IDE which were somewhat time consuming to resolve, however once we figured out the issue and resolved the problems with the IDE our workflow increased drastically.  Another issue we faced was with our own code, as with two people working on it asynchronously we faced some issues when comments were not clear and some code was incorrect due to improper labelling of variable values.  This was resolved with better version control and the application of pair programming techniques.  Overall the lab was successful at it's goals of improving our understanding of the mechanics of transparent subroutines that must work in sequence to perform a specific task.
